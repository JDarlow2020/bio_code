# bio_code
Useful bioinformatics code.
This repository will contain some useful general-purpose bioinformatics code that I have writen during my previous work. This will include code to:
- Convert Ballgown output to more readable CSV files (Ballgown Parser)
- Convert DESeq2 output to more readable CSV files (DESeq2 Parser)
- Prepare GTF files for SQUID SV calling
- Parse FASTA files into repeat motifs
- Convert triplet nucleotide repeats into amino acid code and plot graphs detailing amino acid usage
- Obtain nucleotide sequences from FASTA files based on coordinates from gtf files
